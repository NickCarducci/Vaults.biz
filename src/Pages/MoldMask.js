            More people joined the NRA this year than people are labeled to have
            died of covid (should be "substantial part of death" with at least
            half, partial derivative) if you stopped counting months ago, covid
            exists without killing so most of those deaths are incorrect except
            for the poisoning, no animal-to-human mutation can create that
            Mar2020 death-print is too sudden and likely bad policy (also when
