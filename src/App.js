          "Why does the average cost fall as the marginal costs are rising?"
          <br />
          Average-, and marginal-, costs, in microeconomics, is a logistical-law
          that cites the derivative of, not change-rate of cost, per time nor
          space, but change-rate of cost, per rate of output (
          <a href="https://vaults.biz/newecon">economic welfare</a>
          {space}
          by marginal consumer), per time or space (allocation-scenario). So,
          the diminishing collective bargaining is still a bargain through
          infinity, by reducing operational redundancies (or utility
          indifference of the consumers’ labor?), but at less and less “bang for
          buck,” or value, per output, on average - Average just assumes the
          shared price after a market is “made,” and the price is taken as fact
          (yet non-concurrentable for cash, good-will, like a game of
          telephone), rather than from a spread laid on the bid and ask by a
          bookie (of a new market).

          Income-inequality is a harbinger for asset/productivity-ward
          inequality, the average-labor of the poverty-denomination,
          brought-down. Poverty lowering may not coincide with increased
          inequality by assets’ good will last traded non-concurrentable, and
          cash, if income inequality is short, if income included unrealized
          (concurrentable) capital gains (sold).

          I would upload a photo, but here is income inequality, by age cohort

            into effect a number of policies that might be difficult to sustain
            over a long period of time. Under current law, payment rates for
            physicians’ services in Medicare would be reduced by about 21
            percent in 2010 and then decline further in subsequent years; the
            proposal makes no changes to those provisions. At the same time, the
            legislation includes a number of provisions that would constrain
            payment rates for other providers of Medicare services. In
            particular, **increases in payment rates for many providers would be
            held below the rate of inflation** (in expectation of ongoing
            productivity improvements in the delivery of health care). The
            projected longer-term savings for the legislation also reflect an
            assumption that the Independent Payment Advisory Board established
            by H.R. 3590 would be fairly effective in reducing costs beyond the
            reductions that would be achieved by other aspects of the
