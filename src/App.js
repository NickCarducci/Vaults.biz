        "If aggregate demand increase, does price increase too?"
        <br />
        Tim Pellemeier - "It depends on whether the economy already uses it’s
        entire production potential or not. The economy can be in a state of a
        demand gap, where resources of the economy like labor are not being used
        because of a lack of demand. In this case an increase on aggregate
        demand won’t increase prices, it will only raise output.
        <br />
        <br />
        Keep in mind that unemployment may have other causes than a demand gap.
        In the 70ies for example, a lot of governments thought they could
        decrease unemployment by increasing aggregate demand. The crisis of the
        70ies however was a supply crisis - not a demand crisis. (The oil
        producing nations got a bigger piece from the pie thus the overall pie
        in the western countries got smaller. Trade unions were not willing to
        accept a smaller piece though. Thus there was inflation and stagnation.)
        That’s why the concept of NAIRU was coined.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the economy already uses its full potential, than aggregate demand
        increases prices.
        <br />
        <br />
        We have a demand gap, if the following applies: ex ante aggregate
        savings ( - exports) {">"} ex ante aggregate investments ( + imports)
        (and if the mechanism for bringing both sides into equilibrium is

        "Thank god, you will never be successful with your Saver party, because
        you are not able to explain your ideas in plain English. Anything that
        serves as money, has to be a bubble (because people demand it in order
        to exchange it for something else - thus demand is overblown). It’s
        important that the bubble is not constantly growing (that would be
        deflation) or shrinking at a very fast pace (hyperinflation). Ideally
        it’s constantly getting smaller (fairly low but not too low inflation at
        a stable rate), so that people don’t have an incentive to keep hoarding
        more and more money (if there is deflation) and therefore raping money
        of it’s ability to serve as a means of exchange. As long as this is the
        case, I don’t care for goodwill. By the way, what do you mean with sdr?

        “productive-efficiency,” -GDP/p change-rate being tech-advancement and
        less work), but also finance, being 2/3 of total debt. Debt to checking.

        of these services, or counts non-chores for ones’ own dependents as

        by efficiency or productivity (income/hour)/home of Supply and Labor

        and less partial consumers setting price, like a price control when

        Nick Carducci - BA in Political Science & Economics, Johns Hopkins
        University (Graduated 2015)
        <br />
        Monopsony is a competition with consumers of intermediate materials,
        assets or labor that trust-builds, corners the market and causes a
        dead-weight-box inefficiency of economic-welfare (GDP/hour-GDP/p) along
        the price (y-axis) plane.
        <br />
        <br />
        This adapted dead-weight-box between Marginal Utility Indifference
        propensities of Supply and Demand comes from free rider mutable taxation
        or debt, and like my rendition of the money market where Supply !=
        Labor, the monopsony has the same graphical effect: quality-skew is
        controlled when price is controlled (unless supply already doesn’t equal
        demand), causing more laborless-demand granted by high-quality producers
        eating costs just to keep moving.
