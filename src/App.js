        "If aggregate demand increase, does price increase too?"
        <br />
        Tim Pellemeier - "It depends on whether the economy already uses it’s
        entire production potential or not. The economy can be in a state of a
        demand gap, where resources of the economy like labor are not being used
        because of a lack of demand. In this case an increase on aggregate
        demand won’t increase prices, it will only raise output.
        <br />
        <br />
        Keep in mind that unemployment may have other causes than a demand gap.
        In the 70ies for example, a lot of governments thought they could
        decrease unemployment by increasing aggregate demand. The crisis of the
        70ies however was a supply crisis - not a demand crisis. (The oil
        producing nations got a bigger piece from the pie thus the overall pie
        in the western countries got smaller. Trade unions were not willing to
        accept a smaller piece though. Thus there was inflation and stagnation.)
        That’s why the concept of NAIRU was coined.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the economy already uses its full potential, than aggregate demand
        increases prices.
        <br />
        <br />
        We have a demand gap, if the following applies: ex ante aggregate
        savings ( - exports) {">"} ex ante aggregate investments ( + imports)
        (and if the mechanism for bringing both sides into equilibrium is
        disturbed)"

        "Thank god, you will never be successful with your Saver party, because
        you are not able to explain your ideas in plain English. Anything that
        serves as money, has to be a bubble (because people demand it in order
        to exchange it for something else - thus demand is overblown). It’s
        important that the bubble is not constantly growing (that would be
        deflation) or shrinking at a very fast pace (hyperinflation). Ideally
        it’s constantly getting smaller (fairly low but not too low inflation at
        a stable rate), so that people don’t have an incentive to keep hoarding
        more and more money (if there is deflation) and therefore raping money
        of it’s ability to serve as a means of exchange. As long as this is the
        case, I don’t care for goodwill. By the way, what do you mean with sdr?

        “productive-efficiency,” -GDP/p change-rate being tech-advancement and
        less work), but also finance, being 2/3 of total debt. Debt to checking.

        Our insurance is more liberal/libertarian, CBO in 2010 made it a point
        that Obamacare price controls will work, in matching mean inflation
        (excludes assets outright neighborhood value, labor, profits) as supply
        already doesn’t equate a labor-borne-demand, with false bid pool and
        investment fund over labor-equity’s currency/chequeing land-deed (20% of
        U.S.) loss, without causing quality and output of economic welfare,
        GDP/hour-GDP/p, to fall short of Demand. Education is also relatively
        more expensive, as again, debt is liberal/libertarian, without regard
        for the Savers that own the dollars as donee of the contractor (liable)
        before loitering and laundering. For healthcare and education (e.g. of
        doctors), the most prudent economic policy would be to ban invoices
        (1/12 industry max-royalty ok) and insurance on borrower (force
