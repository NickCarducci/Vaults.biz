          The reconciliation proposal and H.R. 3590 would maintain and put into
          effect a number of policies that might be difficult to sustain over a
          long period of time. Under current law, payment rates for physicians’
          services in Medicare would be reduced by about 21 percent in 2010 and
          then decline further in subsequent years; the proposal makes no
          changes to those provisions. At the same time, the legislation
          includes a number of provisions that would constrain payment rates for
          other providers of Medicare services. In particular, increases in
          payment rates for many providers would be held below the rate of
          inflation (in expectation of ongoing productivity improvements in the
          delivery of health care). The projected longer-term savings for the
          legislation also reflect an assumption that the Independent Payment
          Advisory Board established by H.R. 3590 would be fairly effective in
          reducing costs beyond the reductions that would be achieved by other
          aspects of the legislation.8

          effect a number of policies that might be difficult to sustain over a
          long period of time. Under current law, payment rates for physicians’
          services in Medicare would be reduced by about 21 percent in 2010 and
          then decline further in subsequent years; the proposal makes no
          changes to those provisions. At the same time, the legislation
          includes a number of provisions that would constrain payment rates for
          other providers of Medicare services. In particular, increases in
          payment rates for many providers would be held below the rate of
          inflation (in expectation of ongoing productivity improvements in the
          delivery of health care). The projected longer-term savings for the
          legislation also reflect an assumption that the Independent Payment

        "What are negative externalities?"
        <hr />
        When you say *negative externalities*, you are necessarily either making
        an **assumption of harm**, or **shortcoming of a negative correlation**,
        that is unmeasured.
        <hr />
        For example, I’m proposing that enumerating the economic-welfare
        (microeconomic Supply and Demand) basis, q* per time-period, would be
        GDP/hours-GDP/p; *negative externalities** are things that cause
        endogenousness of **factors or variables* in a functional-curve on a
        graphical-plane, x-axis being time and Y being index, yet are exhausted
        things that are unaccounted for. **If your variable is a constant (not
        negative nor positive) it is considered exogenous, otherwise it is
        endogenous - where you would cite unmeasured assumptions**. Sidebar: I
        believe -iosity would make it a reflexive, rather than introspective,
        meaning an *adjective* of strength of such a variable, endogenous (or
        constant, exogenous).
        <hr />
        The negatives to productive-efficiency are laborless-demand of
        landlords, lenders, insurers, corrupt-juris and cornerers of
        labor-costs; however, these are **unmeasured factors to my regressional
        hypothesis, until I plot them**. Normally, *econometricians will draw
        their regression and then explain away the 1 minus R correlation*, and
        why their negative externalities, which in this case might exclusively
        be in regards to a **negative correlation, are unmeasurable and yet are
        a partial derivatious effectual-cause of no doubt**.

        <br />
        Welfare is funded by stock, cornering the market by labor costs for a
        pittance, which increases GDP/p tech deprecation. The parts of welfare
        funded by tax and debt are pure inflation for coming from outside the

        "What is the relationship between actual GDP, potential GDP,

        <br />
        Inflation, wage-increases and market-concentration/cornering-equity
        causes heightened GDP/p tech deprecation, which can cause unemployment
        by cornering the market and employment by price; skilled labor gets the
        skew of investment funds. The maximum potential GDP/p, or tech
        deprecation, is to maximize market concentration of equity,
        productivity’s ward. Otherwise, population is integrally GDP, we humans
        actually consume (and work) the same quality and quantity of goods,
        services, and assets time to time, discounting for ALL prices…

        <br />
        Rental, lending and insurance income are funded by cornering the labor
        market, by stock and structures. It is essential to withstand an aging
        median age (lower births, historically, 5m/yr U.S. amidst 2%/yr+) by
        ending these laborless sources of demand to ease income inequality and
        therefore market concentration or wealth inequality.

        <h3>"Why did Donald Trump have the best economy in U.S. history?"</h3>
        Trump did nothing for China/USPTO in tariffs, albeit rent-seeking
        science is detrimental to comparative advantage and technological
        advancement, and his, “drain the swamp,” epitaph meant *court
        appointments*, evidently, **not the debts of public and private sector,
        nor stock invested welfare**.

        If I were President, I would reverse the debt and stop investing in
        stocks for welfare, or labor-equity and market competition for pittance
        and dependency. All in all, I would describe him as *swampy*. However, I
        am friendly with crass personalities, and he certainly is good at
        misleading, leaving *drain the swamp* to our imaginations during his
        campaign. My first vote cast was 2020, for Jo Jorgensen, yet the

        Labor costs more because their input costs are assets, but poverty

        Although there are many laws, scarcely any are meaningful. There just
        isn’t a lot of commotion in politics, and even rarer does precedence
        change. Basis rate fallacy is when your prevalence isn’t regarded as
        normal, but it actually is. That is sort of like this, assuming
        democracies devise faster or implement slower than a representation;
        however it might depend on how majorities are founded, and the deduced
        democracy being direct by referenda, or not and authoritarian. Carrying
        out would be the same, unless you consider and appeals or petitioning
        process.
        <br />
        <br />I would characterize democracies, especially that of direct,
        advisory democracy as the best sourced, by everyone and all industries’
        variably, and carrying out is the same, or better with democracy as
        including appeals. Other than that, democracy has no modus in

        If the economies aren't equally efficient, a trade surplus means
        materials are exported for foreign currency, more than imported for

        Deflating the balance of trade not from a series or single year
        inflation (excludes assets, profits, labor), but assets/(income/hours),
        might show a balance of trade if 0, although nominally for Afghanistan

        "Does insurance provide a utility, or does it take more than give, like
        voluntary trade?"
        <br />
        Insurance is a network provider, if anything. If it did, it would
        rollover, non-compete concurrentables - as opposed to the name your
        price tool of claim costs and expiring premiums, you can never be made

        "What are the reasons for the backward bending supply curve of labour?"
        <br />
        The microeconomic curves are in order of marginal propensities, and
        normal distribution has tails of outliers. So, it is natural for the
        most elastic propensity to be **eager** to sell/bid-proposal-with their
        hours, at the inception of the market. I would describe bottom left to
        top right *concave downwards*, mean price being lower than the median

        "Why does total utility increased as the consumer moves to an
        indifference curve farther from the origin?"

        Economic welfare, output or utility is more efficient productivity
        (GDP/hour, discounted by GDP/p tech deprecation), as **input costs is
        lessened by competition, or, **target margin operational network

        instance, computer chip shortage needs to be subsidized for, which is an
